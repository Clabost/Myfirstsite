<h1> Bionicle: Matoran Adventures</h1>
  The game takes place on the fictional island of Mata Nui, which is called a "tropical paradise" with six thematic regions[1]. Each region (Ga-Wahi water region, Le-Wahi Jungle region, Ko-Wahi ice and mountain region, Onu-Wahi Underground region, Po-Wahi Desert region and Ta-Wahi Volcanic region) makes up one of the six levels of the game. The game follows a Matoran who tries to repel an invasion by a swarm of Bohroks. In the official Bionicle story, bohrok defeats Toa.

<p>Matoran Adventures is a side—scrolling platformer with puzzle elements. The player can choose one of three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium and Difficult).</p> <p>The game uses a character change mechanic similar to The Lost Vikings. If necessary, the player can switch between Matoran and Turaga to overcome obstacles. The Matoran character can jump and throw discs to fight enemies, while the Turaga character can overcome obstacles using his elemental power, andactivate the switches</p>. <p>Turaga's character cannot jump as high as Matoran[4]. The game has six levels and three boss encounters. The disk of the Matoran character improves as the game progresses. The game also has parts of masks scattered throughout the levels.</p> <p>By collecting all the parts of a certain mask, they get the opportunity to play as another Matoran character. One Matoran character, Kongu, is available from the beginning; the other five Matoran characters must be unlocked.</p>
