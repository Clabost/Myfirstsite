  <h1> Lego DC</h1>
<p>
Every so often I tend to go back to older projects and work on them from scratch. This gives me a fantastic oportunity to truly see the progress I have accomplished over the years.</p>

<p>With this project I revisited an old piece I did in 2014 when I was starting to play with Cinema4D. Eight years and one <a href="http://example.com/" style="color:#bd379b;">Batman The Lego Movie</a> later, I came up with this piece. I really hope you enjoy it as much as I did working on it.</p>

<p>All models were downloaded from <a href="http://example.com/" style="color:#bd379b;">Mecabricks</a> site, whome I can not thank enough for the fantastic job they do. Once downloaded, the scene was assembled in <a href="http://example.com/" style="color:#bd379b;">Cinema4D</a>
  and some pieces needed retopology for optimal bending, so <a href="http://example.com/" style="color:#bd379b;">zBrush</a> was my go to for this part of the process. Textures, shaders and lights were worked with Redshift Render and final compositing done in Adobe Photoshop.</p>
